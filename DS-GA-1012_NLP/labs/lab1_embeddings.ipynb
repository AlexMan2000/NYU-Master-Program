We can quantify this semantic similarity by constructing a **co-occurrence matrix**; that is, given a corpus of text, a vocabulary list and a fixed window size, we count the number of times that each vocab word occurs in the context of all other words. Then if our window size is $k$, the $ij$-th entry of our co-occurrence matrix $X$ is the number of times that vocab word $i$ occurs within $k$ words of vocab word $j$."],"metadata":{"id":"ysc1ujNLWpLW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["GloVe embeddings are trained such that for the embeddings $w_i$ and $w_j$ of words $i$ and $j$,\n","\n","$$w_i^Tw_j \\propto \\log(X_{ij})$$\n","\n","where $X_{ij}$ is the co-occurrence of words $i$ and $j$ in the training corpus.
